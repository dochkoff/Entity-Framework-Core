# Entity Framework Core

## Course Description

[The course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/4234/entity-framework-core-october-2023) follows in detail the work with the ORM technology: Entity Framework Core (EF Core), which is a standard for ORM in C# and .NET Core applications. EF Core enables mapping between a relational base and an object-oriented model through appropriate "Database First" and "Code First" and provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and performing CRUD operations. EF Core provides both an additional level of abstraction and an easy way to process database data. The course will demonstrate best practices for building the database layer of complex systems in C# applications through built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and using the Service Layer, as well as importing and exporting to various data formats (JSON, XML).
